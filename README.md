Web catalog of virtual tours powered by Drupal

I have created virtual tours of pubic and local business places in some Finnish cities. The domain has expired and I didn't prolong it since I don't offer such service anymore. I have uploaded website files to active domain to show it though.

Website is built with Drupal 7. I used power of Drupal core and contributed modules to make multilingual versions. The website has also city detection features for better user experience.

I have added new content types for public places and for local businesses. Visual presentation of a place is organized in tabs , first tab contains virtual tour, second tab contains gallery and third tab contains Google map.
Content type for local businesses has additional tabs such as videos and menus.

I created subtheme of Sky theme. I created custom templates for content types and applied needed css styles.

I wrote small custom module to extend Getlocations module and add own location markers to the map.

I didn't upload all Drupal files here, I did upload my theme files and my custom module files though.

Also if you'd like to have a look to admin dashboard, here are my temporary credentials:
